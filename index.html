                    <h1>About Me:</h1>

                    My name is Samuel Cohen. I was born in Ceuta, Spain, grew up in Seattle, Washington, and after some traveling I have ended up in New York City, where I attend Macaulay Honors College at The City College of New York. There, I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, and will graduate in spring 2017.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of school, I am an avid reader who often cannot put down a book he starts. I am also a videogame lover, and I watch way too much TV. Another interest of mine is languages; I'm trilingual, and hope to learn more in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    Academically, I am very interested in machine learning, having done both research and class work on it. I also am intrigued by Cryptography, and to that aim I'm taking courses on Security and Number Theory this year. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    If you're interested in looking at my code, I have a Github <a href = "http://github.com/slamwell17">here</a>.

                    <h2>Research:</h2>
                    In spring 2016, I studied under Professor Gertner at City College in the field of machine learning. Specifically, my project concerned image classification of satellite pictures of ships in the ocean. I used Python's Scikit-learn library in order to find an efficient way to do this. After a few months, we were able to present and publish at the SPIE-DES conference in April 2016. Our paper can be found <a href = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2234847">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    <h2>Leadership:</h2>
                    At City College I have taken various leadership roles:<br>
                    Currently I am Treasurer on the CCNY Hillel board. Hillel is a Jewish campus organization. At CCNY we're a very active club, hosting events at least once a week bringing the Jewish community of City together.
                    <br>
                    Last year I was Google Student Ambassador for CCNY. That meant I was the official liaison between Google and my campus, so whenever they wanted to get the word out about internships, scholarships, or services that might be relevant to students, I was their contact point. In this capacity, I organized several events on campus.
                    <h2>Classes:</h2>
                    I've taken a lot of classes in my years of college. However, the ones that I liked the most and found the most valuable include Data Structures, Algorithms, Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Architecture, and Linear Algebra, among others. I am also taking Computer Security, Web Development, and Number Theory this semester, which should be invaluable.
                    <h2>Languages:</h2>
                    I am familiar with Java, Python, and C++.<br>
                    I have some knowledge of Scheme, JavaScript, C, PHP, all of which I hope to learn better about.

                    <h2>On the Culture series</h2>
                    I know I'm a decade or two late, but lately I've been hooked on Iain M. Banks's science-fiction series about The Culture. If you haven't heard of it, The Culture is a series of books set in a fictional post-scarcity, spacefaring society. All of its citizens are perfectly healthy, live for hundreds of years (if they choose to die at all), and have no worries, as everything is run by hyper-intelligent artificial Minds. Of course this makes for boring stories, so most of the stories in this world concern people on the periphery of this Culture.<br><br>

                    Reading it, I'm torn whether or not this is a good Utopia to live in. Of course, to live without war, disease, or even minor discomfort is something that anybody should want. It's probably a sign of my relative comfort that I'm able to even ponder this; a person who right now has nothing to eat would certainly think I'm crazy for not wanting to spend life in paradise. At the same time, though, I think there is something missing from Utopian experience. All the pleasure in the universe is great, but I think in this world I would feel unfulfilled. There's no <em>reason</em> to do anything! 
                    This isn't something anyone on Earth is going to have to think about for a while, but it is still food for thought, and an example of my favorite kind of science fiction: the kind that makes you re-examine something about humanity today.
